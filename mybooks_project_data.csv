2,TULIP OF ISTANBUL,Iskender Pala,Niyogi Books,2021,Available,392,Same Day Dispatch,English,396,Paperback,https://cms.buybooksindia.com/uploads/books/9789391125233_0_1637732871.jpeg,"  Tulip of Istanbul is a historical novel depicting the Ottoman empire’s most glorious times in art and aesthetic, elegance and grandeur of dreams. At the same time, it was an era of splurge and wastage, of economic and social collapse. Known as the Tulip Age, this period saw in 1730 a great public revolt which changed the course of Turkey’s destiny.
The novel begins with the story of a young man who finds his beautiful wife murdered on the wedding night. What is more perverse, the innocent young man himself is charged with the murder of his own wife and thrown into prison. In order to prove his innocence and to find the murderer of his lover, his only clue is a tulip bulb that he found in the palm of his dead wife. He has a secret identity which he was initially unaware of; he is a prince, a sultan’s son, who has grown up outside the palace. An intrigue develops in the power circle about his rumoured existence.
The story is interweaved with historical and cultural detail, introducing the reader to life within royal palaces and dervish lodges, to horticultural secrets about growing exclusive tulips, innovative treatment for the insanes in the asylum, torture devices in the prison, and to the conspiracies hatched in coffee houses and hamams by disaffected revolutionaries and gangsters.
Iskender Pala creates a bewitching tapestry of the splendours and vices of Istanbul at a time when the world was still in thrall to its military, political, and artistic achievements.

This time period, essentially the computer age, had little impact on the nature of his work personally, but rather the nature of society and the human animal, is what inspired him. In other words, what he wrote about then, still very much relates to now. The book contains a variety of styles and forms including a section with 101 Haiku, 2 pages of 1 liners, and a very telling excerpt from 'Hero's Journey' - the chronicles of his trip to 'Burningman' in 1997. The structure and language of classical poetry is evident in his style, however, his rhyme skills, coupled with wordplay, multi-layered subtext and street wise insight will give the reader plenty to consider. The chronological format plays an important part in the layout of this work as it allows the reader to view the artist in personal and spiritual evolution. It is an unwitting look into the heart and mind of the man-child and for the most part, is a weight that has been lifted, off of his floor, and into a book.

To God all prophets are important, whether they speak a little or a lot. Even if God only gave you three words for somebody else, that is prophecy. You don't need to do it at length for fifty years as some prophets did. There are some prophets in the Old Testament who only speak once, and then, as far as we know, they disappear; but they have given a message from God. This is all a prophet is: someone who has heard a message and passes it on to the right people. It is such a simple ministry. You don't need to be theologically educated; you don't need to be a public speaker. In fact, God seems to entrust this ministry to those who don't have a gift of oratory. It is exciting to hear ordinary folk, who would never be able to get up into a pulpit and preach a sermon, hear from God and pass on a word from him",https://www.buybooksindia.com/a-commentary-on-the-minor-prophets-9781911173946-61123.htm,mid range

Who is he? How did he get there? For a man who used both the lectern and the pen to devastating effect during the Indian Independence movement led by the likes of Gandhi and Nehru, little is known of Syud Hossain. Born to an aristocratic family in Calcutta, he forayed into journalism early in life and became the editor of Motilal Nehru’s nationalist newspaper, The Independent. After a brief elopement with Motilal’s daughter, Sarup (aka Vijaya Lakshmi Pandit), Hossain, under immense pressure from Nehru and Gandhi, annulled the marriage and stayed away from the country. Thus began several years of exile. Eventually, he landed in the United States. Flitting from one place to another, making homes of hotel rooms, he imparted Gandhi’s message across the country. He fought for India’s cause from afar, garnering support in the United States and decrying British oppression. Syud Hossain inspired and irked in equal measure; with every speech he delivered and every editorial he penned, he sent a shiver down the spine of the colonial ruler. In addition, Hossain took on the fight for Indian immigrant rights in the United States, one that successfully culminated in President Truman signing the Luce-Celler Bill into an Act in 1946. Hossain returned to India to witness the triumph of her independence as well as the tragedy of Gandhi’s assassination. Thereafter appointed India’s first ambassador to Egypt, he died while in service and was laid to rest in Cairo. A Forgotten Ambassador in Cairo offers an illuminating narrative of Hossain’s life interspersed with historical details that landscapes a vivid political picture of that era. Through primary sources that include Hossain’s private papers, British Intelligence files, and contemporary correspondence and newspapers, N.S. Vinodh brilliantly brings to life a man who has been relegated far too long to the shadows of time.",https://www.buybooksindia.com/a-forgotten-ambassador-in-cairo-the-life-and-times-of-syud-hossain--9788194752028-9034.htm,low range

A new government had taken charge, and the economy was facing a tough time. It was not the best of times to predict that India had it in her to get on the fast track to development. The vision presented in the book would go on to inspire, directly or indirectly, many sectors of the economy to work for and achieve high growth. The book has since sold hundreds of thousands of copies. In A Manifesto for Change, its author A.P.J. Abdul Kalam, writing with co-author V. Ponraj, offers a sequel. As focused then as now on his dream of a developed India by 2020, the eleventh President of India examines what we need to get right to accomplish that essential goal: harnessing the stupendous energy of our youth to contribute to growth, a united Parliament that makes full use of its time for constructive debate and rises above petty party politics to achieve the larger national vision, and a plan of action that looks at development from the grassroots to giant strides in infrastructure and bridging the urban-rural disparity.

Engineering Professor Barbara Oakley knows first-hand how it feels to struggle with math. She flunked her way through high school math and Science courses, before enlisting in the army immediately after graduation. When she saw how her lack of mathematical and technical savvy severely limited her options—both to rise in the military and to explore other careers—she returned to school with a newfound determination to re-tool her brain to master the very subjects that had given her so much trouble throughout her entire life. In a mind for numbers, Dr. Oakley lets us in on the secrets to learning effectively—secrets that even dedicated and successful students wish they’d known earlier. Contrary to popular belief, math requires creative, as well as analytical, thinking. Most people think that there’s only one way to do a problem, when in actuality, there are often a number of different solutions—you just need the creativity to see them. For example, there are more than three hundred different known proofs of the Pythagorean theorem. In short, studying a problem in a laser-focused way until you reach a solution is not an effective way to learn. Rather, it involves taking the time to step away from a problem and allow the more relaxed and creative part of the brain to take over. The learning strategies in this book apply not only to math and Science, but to any subject in which we struggle. We all have what it takes to excel in areas that don't seem to come naturally to us at first, and learning them does not have to be as painful as we might think.",https://www.buybooksindia.com/a-mind-for-numbers-how-to-excel-at-math-and-science-9780593419052-49920.htm,low range

By doing this he mocks the authority of the British officials. A Modest Proposal is included in many literature programs as an example of early modern western satire. It also serves as an exceptional introduction to the concept and use of argumentative language, lending itself well to secondary and post-secondary essay courses.

The news arrives on the heels of an email from Anjum, an impassioned yet aloof activist Krishnan fell in love with years before while living in Delhi, stirring old memories and desires from a world he left behind. As Krishan makes the long journey by train from Colombo into the war-torn Northern Province for Rani's funeral, so begins an astonishing passage into the innermost reaches of a country. At once a powerful meditation on absence and longing, as well as an unsparing account of the legacy of Sri Lanka's thirty-year civil war, this procession to a pyre 'at the end of the earth' lays bare the imprints of an island's past and the unattainable distances between who we are and what we seek.

The story is set in pre-Independence India, when it was ruled by the British, and it questions whether a friendship between a British person and an Indian would have been possible in those prejudiced times. The book begins with two Englishwomen, the old Mrs Moore and Miss Adela Quested deciding to tour India. Mrs Moor befriends a charismatic Indian doctor named Aziz. A few days later, Aziz offers to take the ladies on a trip to the Marabar Caves. Mrs Moore feels claustrophobic once they are there so she decides to stay behind, and Aziz and Adela continue exploring the caves. In the darkness of the caves, Adela goes missing and Aziz finds her broken spectacles. He searches for her worriedly, only to find her talking to another Englishwoman outside. The two of them leave before he can go up to them, so he returns to the railway station with Mrs Moore. However, Aziz is soon taken into custody for sexually assaulting Adela in the caves. The case causes the racial tension and prejudices between the Indian and the white community to bubble up and boil over. The British people are convinces of Aziz’s guilt because their prejudice directs them to believe that all Indian men cannot contain their lust for British women.

Raghavan has had a tumultuous career—full of successes, yes, but also one where he stood at the edge of some of India’s biggest fault lines.
On 21 May 1991, in Sriperumbudur, he was in charge of Congress leader Rajiv Gandhi’s protection detail. Raghavan was only a few yards from Gandhi when the former prime minister was assassinated by the Sri Lankan Liberation Tigers of Tamil Eelam. It was a crushing blow to the nation, and one that left the top cop shaken to his core.
Years later, Raghavan handled investigations into the Bofors scam, the cricket match-fixing scandal and the horrific Gujarat riots of 2002—key events that came to define India’s national character. R.K. Raghavan has been not only witnessed the country’s turbulent journey, but has been right at the centre as pivotal events unfolded. In some instances, he determined their course.
An Indian Police Service officer, Raghavan went on to become director-general of Tamil Nadu’s State Vigilance Directorate and then to head the Interpol and the CBI. A Road Well Travelled chronicles his rise through the ranks of the nation’s protectors and gatekeepers—from his first posting in a small town in southern India to his sojourn at the sequestered worlds of the Intelligence Bureau and the CBI, as well as his investigations abroad.

In fact, it can be adopted as a model for the battle against any wide-spread disease in the developing world. The book should interest medical professionals, health authorities and non-government organisations engaged in public cause campaigns. It makes an interesting reading how individuals and organisations in diverse fieldsâ€”religion, sports, films, art and culture, social service and even politicsâ€”were motivated and activised to participate in the movement. Innovative and imaginative methods were used, old traditional practices and modern management methods were simultaneously used to achieve quick and effective results. In brief, it is a guide for policy planners and health workers and an insight in a public campaign which will interest a general reader. The children of the world shall remain indebted to all involved in global efforts for eradication of poliomyelitis throughout their lives but we should not forget that as long as a single child remains infected anywhere in the world, children in all countries are at risk of contracting polio. The news that in 2009-2010, 23 previously polio free countries were re-infected due to imports of the virus should be an eye opener for everyone involved in these gigantic efforts and should motivate us enough to take the last of the last few steps of polio eradication initiative with thorough caution. Let us once again take a pledge in 2017 to revive the national spirit of the year 1995 to fight other diseases now like polio and unite again to develop health as a big social movement in the country. If we can ensure â€˜Health for allâ€™ we can ensure a better and stronger future for our country too. We have made history again after small pox eradication. This is now every countrymenâ€™s chance to make history for achieving health for all.

It begins simply enough: A twenty-something advertising executive receives a postcard from a friend, and casually appropriates the image for an insurance company’s advertisement. What he doesn’t realise is that included in the pastoral scene is a mutant sheep with a star on its back, and in using this photo he has unwittingly captured the attention of a man in black who offers a menacing ultimatum: find the sheep or face dire consequences. Thus begins a surreal and elaborate quest that takes our hero from the urban haunts of Tokyo to the remote and snowy mountains of northern Japan, where he confronts not only the mythological sheep, but the confines of tradition and the demons deep within himself. Quirky and utterly captivating, A Wild Sheep Chase is Murakami at his astounding best.

While Ratanâ€™s story is one of irreparable damage to a childâ€™s psyche, through callous handling, spilling onto his adult life, Ram Khilawanâ€™s is a contrast where familial love inspires a child to put aside his trauma and attain the impossible despite poverty. Who would believe that, even in independent India, children are bought and sold to slog as cheap labour? Where children are not spared, what would the plight of animals be! But here the author infuses hope through stories where animals return in equal measure the love and trust they receive from humans who treat them as family. Readers meet fascinating women confronted with irresponsible men and downright evil ones too. But nothing stops these women from taking the first step to a leap into liberation and self-empowerment.

This was a diamond with a far more violent history than her sisters. Her existence was zealously guarded down the ages by a select circle. Over time, even her name disappeared from all historical texts, bards’ tales and living memory itself. The modern-day search for the lost jewel begins in two different corners of the world, involving a British research scholar in London and an Indian historian in Calcutta. The British scholar finds mention of the Aasma-i-Noor in the documents left behind by Sir Robert Clive. The historian from India is the descendant of a Raja, who was Clive’s friend and confidante. The Battle of Plassey in 1757, the downfall of Nawab Siraj-ud Daulah, the death of Clive and the treachery of Mir Jafar, all combine to create a maze of cryptic clues and devilish dead ends for the unlikely partners.

The author uses her bold style to write on a topic which is considered taboo by most Indian authors. The story is sensuous and exciting, fit for the modern society in which it is set.
The story of Accidentally In Love revolves around Chhavi Mukherjee. She is a model, who has managed to navigate through dark waters of the industry and secure a place for herself as a reputed model. Just when she feels that nothing could go wrong with her life, fate decides to throw a few surprises in her path. Apart from the cut-throat competition which she has to encounter on a daily basis, she comes across Tushar, a successful photographer, who sweeps her off her feet. What ensues is an erotic relationship where sparks fly. The two of them are flooded with desire at first sight. It’s a relationship that is based purely on the passion that the two souls share for each other. Chhavi does not believe in love and so a relationship with no-strings-attached suits her just fine. She believes that a relationship without commitment or plans for the future, based on just passion, is for the best.
As the story continues, Chhavi finds herself getting more and more attached to Tushar and she begins to enjoy her relationship for more than just the few moments of passion.One day, when Tushar leaves for work, Chhavi starts missing him and realises that she has grown fond of him. Find out if Chhavi is able to confront Tushar with her feelings.
Accidentally In Love is a masterpiece which shows that in the end, love always triumphs. It emphasises on how those fleeting feelings of lust always give way to the everlasting joys of love.

'Acres of Diamonds' is a lecture that Russell Conwell, founder of Temple University, delivered more than 6,000 times across the country. Through this lecture, Conwell debunks the idea that it is noble to be poor, an idea that far too many Christians share. He illustrates that it is our duty as Christians to use our gifts to honestly earn riches, because you can do more good with riches than without. Conwell successfully illustrates the difference between the popular expression 'money is the root of all evil' and the complete Biblical passage which states 'the love of money is the root of all evil'. The love of money is idolatry, but money itself is neither good nor evil. It is simply a tool which may be used for either good or evil. In these pages we learn the virtues of earning money through honest, hard work. We learn to look for opportunities to serve others in our own back yard by simply finding a need and filling it. If you wish to be great, begin with who you are right now, where you are right now. Follow these principles, and you will uncover your own acres of diamonds.

Agamemnon had dedicated much of his life to a war that his brother started. He vowed to do whatever it takes to winâ€•committing war crimes and killing innocents. But, even in victory, Agamemnon feels unsatisfied and plagued by the bloodshed he caused. Because of this, he decides to perform a ritual to clear his conscience and regain the godsâ€™ approval. After he fought for ten years in the Trojan war, Clytemnestra eagerly awaited the return of her husband, King Agamemnon. However, upon his arrival, she learns that he has sacrificed one of her loved ones to the gods, in order to win their favor. Though Agamemnon expressed slight remorse, he felt resolute in his actions, as he viewed the sacrifice as a necessity. Already devastated, Clytemnestra is driven to pure rage when she finds that Agamemnon also brought back a â€œspoil of warâ€, Cassandra, a Trojan princess and prophetess, who has been punished by the god Apollo for refusing his advances. Though she is able to see the future, she is cursed to be never believed. Considered as Agamemnonâ€™s war prize, Cassandra is trapped in the kingdom, especially hopeless when she receives a vision of unescapable doom. Meanwhile, as Clytemnestra settles in her grief and rage, she creates a plot for vengeance, and much like her husband at war, is unconcerned about any collateral damage. As the first installment of the sole surviving Greek trilogy, Agamemnon is both a stand-alone piece and a compliment to later plays. With symbolism and precise prose, Agamemnon by Aeschylus depicts the consequences of warfareâ€•both abroad and domestic.

Soon after it was established, the royal city of Ahmedabad became the commercial and cultural capital of Gujarat. When the Mughal Empire annexed Gujarat in 1572, Ahmedabad lost its political pre-eminence, but continued to flourish as a great trading center connecting the silk route with the spice route. Briefly under the Marathas in the eighteenth century, Ahmedabad experienced a dimming of its fortunes, but with the beginning of British control from the early nineteenth century the city reasserted its mercantile ethos, even as it began questioning age-old social hierarchies. The opening of the first textile mill in 1861 was a turning point and by the end of the century Ahmedabad was known as the Manchester of the East. When Gandhi returned to India from South Africa in 1915, looking for a place where he could establish â€˜an institution for the whole of Indiaâ€™, it was Ahmedabad he chose. With the setting up of his Sabarmati Ashram, the great manufacturing center also became a center for new awakening. It became the political hub of India, radiating the message of freedom struggle based on truth and non-violence. After Independence, it emerged as one of the fastest-growing cities of India and in the 1960s Ahmedabadis pioneered institutions of higher education and research in new fields such as space sciences, management, design and architecture. Yet, through the centuries, Ahmedabadâ€™s prosperity has been punctuated by natural disasters and social discord, from famines and earthquakes to caste and religious violence. Ahmedabadis have tried to respond to these, trying to meld economic progress with a new culture of social harmony.",https://www.buybooksindia.com/ahmedabad-from-royal-city-to-megacity--9780143415787-37969.htm,low range

A few years later, he returns to Banaras to write that book.
Plunging into its timeless aura, he roams its ghats and galis, sails through the cool breeze of the Ganga, walks through the heat of funeral pyres. One moment he is observing a sadhu show off his penile strength, in the next he is on a boat with a young woman who has been prophesied to marry seven times; one moment he is in conversation with the celebrated writer Kashinath Singh, who is an atheist, and in the next he is having tea with a globe- trotting priest and a god-fearing doctor ... Ghosh finds a story in every bend as he engages with quintessential Banarasis—their paan-stuffed mouths spouting expletives and wisdom with equal flair—and discovers why they are among the happiest people on earth.
Then one evening at Manikarnika, as he emerges from a temple, wearing ash from the cremation ground on his forehead, he finds a bit of Banaras in himself.

Rebecca Bynum does that. She discusses Islam and its status in the modern world with a depth and precision missing in many modern accounts and sadly concludes that the great hope of secularizing the Muslim world is a pipe dream. It is much more likely, according to Bynum, that the secular world will be Islamized. Overall, however, her analysis is hopeful and provides an important ideological tool for dealing with Islam which is to reconsider its classification. Bynum maintains Islam s current status as a religion, along with all the other religions of the world, is in error. She refers to Islam as the duck-billed platypus of belief systems and proposes it should be classified accordingly; as the hybrid religio-socio-political belief system it is. She also reminds the Western world about what religion itself actually is, not the caricature modern analysts often mean when they refer to ""religious fundamentalisms."" Bynum has given policy-makers a powerful tool for dealing with Islam.

Take comfort in knowing you're not alone, as Amy Borkowsky shares more than a decade's worth of maddening phone messages from her hilariously overprotective mom. Based on the hit CD of the same name, Amy's Answering Machine features actual messages in which Amy's mom warns her not to wear a red bathrobe because a friend's grandson ""said that red is a gang color""...advises her not to get a cat because ""what if you finally found a nice guy and he was allergic?""...cautions her not to wear crepe-soled shoes because ""they were just saying on the news that if you're ever in a plane crash, crepe is no good if you have to go down the slide."" Amy also reveals the stories behind the messages and shares calls not available on CD, each one brimming with the worry and annoying comments only a loving mother could dish out. The same warnings and suggestions that had Amy cringing are sure to have you doubled over with laughter. But before you turn the page, take some advice from Amy's mom: Make sure you have plenty of reading light, because squinting causes crow's feet.",https://www.buybooksindia.com/amy-s-answering-machine-messages-from-mom-9781451624137-74438.htm,low range

Authored by Kaushik Basu, this book reveals his two and half year tenure as the Chief Economic Advisor. This is not a mere personal perspective of Basu’s work but is a reflection on the art of policy making in the world’s largest democracy, India. It includes some interesting personal experiences, engaging discussions and bundles of information citing India’s governing structure. This book has been published by Viking publishers in 2016. Kaushik Basu, an acclaimed academician and noted economist left the comfortable world of academics and joined the rigorous domain of policy making, back when the former Indian Prime Minister Dr. Manmohan Singh appointed him as the chief economic adviser (CEA) to the Government of India. Basu worked in that position from 2009 to 2012. These three years saw substantial transformation in the world economy and similarly in our nation's economic policies as well. Basu, in this book talks about some of the pressing issues faced by a developing economy like growth and equality, globalization and sovereignty, laws and corruption, policy making and politics. Discussing various notions ranging from macroeconomic to fiscal and monetary policies; and from the granular of designing grain auctions to the dream of ensuring every citizen has access to basic food, this book is full of economic wisdom. It also sheds light on the dinner hosted by Dr. Manmohan Singh, where President Obama joked to him, “You should give this guy some tips” and “this guy” was Timothy Geithner. Thus, this is a vital document on the features of effective economic policy making and a myriad of obstacles advisors get to face.",https://www.buybooksindia.com/an-economist-in-the-real-world-the-art-of-policymaking-in-india-9780670088751-37974.htm,low range

In a matter of weeks, the series became a national obsession. During the Ramayan slot, roads emptied out. No marriages and political rallies were scheduled for that time. More than three decades later, there has been nothing to match it.
Ramanand Sagar, the man behind the phenomenon and a successful filmmaker from Bombay, was among the first to recognise the immense power of television. He first made his mark as a writer in Raj Kapoor’s Barsat (1949). From 1961 to 1970, Sagar wrote, produced, and directed six consecutive silver jubilee hits—Ghunghat, Zindagi, Arzoo, Ankhen, Geet, and Lalkar.
An Epic Life: Ramanand Sagar, From Barsaat to Ramayan, written by his son, Prem Sagar, an award-winning cinematographer, is an intimate look at the life of a visionary. It traces Sagar’s life from his birth in Kashmir in 1917, his dramatic escape in 1947 when Pakistani tribesmen attacked the state, his arrival in Bombay and his subsequent glorious career—the crowning achievement of which was the smashing success of Ramayan.",https://www.buybooksindia.com/an-epic-life-ramanand-sagar-from-barsaat-to-ramayan--9789388754804-33408.htm,low range

First published in March 1927, the book was widely read and influenced the imaginative literature of the day. An Experiment with Time divides into two main topics. The first half of the book describes a number of precognitive dreams, most of which Dunne himself had experienced. His key conclusion was that such precognitive visions foresee future personal experiences by the dreamer and not more general events. The second half develops a theory to try and explain the dreams. Dunne's starting point is the observation that the moment of ""now"" is not described by science. Contemporary science described physical time as a fourth dimension and Dunne's argument led to an endless sequence of higher dimensions of time to measure our passage through the dimension below. Accompanying each level was a higher level of consciousness.

Intuitively, one might answer - happiness. But do we really know what happiness is? Most of the existing literature paints a fuzzy picture of happiness, beautiful in words but lacking in practicality. In this book, Acharya Prashant shatters all misconceptions about happiness jargons like 'loving unconditionally' and 'living in the present'. He explains how what we commonly understand as happiness exists only in the backdrop of sadness, and what man is really looking for is not just happiness, but Ananda - an unconditional joy free from both happiness and sadness. Discarding multiple myths that burden our consciousness, the book draws from scriptures like the Gita and the Upanishads, revealing the true meaning of Ananda. If you have the courage to question your deep-rooted beliefs and enter an unfathomable territory beyond the duality of happiness and sadness, this book is for you.",https://www.buybooksindia.com/ananda-happiness-without-reason-9789356292192-72799.htm,low range

Though religion can certainly help in this, the Dalai Lama demonstrates that there are universal principles we can draw on which transcend the dilemma of belief or unbelief. And whilst many have been content to speak of spiritual matters as something mysterious or evanescent, the Dalai Lama explains his approach in terms that are as clear and concise as they are compelling. With wit, gentle good sense and with penetrating insight, the Dalai Lama shows how the truths that have stood the test of generations of practise can provide us with the tools to live happy, fulfilled and meaningful lives.

However, for those who revere Rand's work and subscribe to her particular philosophy of objectivism this novel could be set in the present day instead of some unidentified future in which mankind has entered a dark age characterized by irrationality, collectivism, and socialistic thinking. In this dystopian novella we find a world where technological advancement is now carefully planned and the concept of individuality has been eliminated. The central characters of the story are Equality 7-2521, a free thinking inventor, and his love interest, Liberty 5-3000. Like most dystopian works, ""Anthem"" describes a strange and unfathomable world which could never exist. It is in the creation of this extreme world that Rand creates a parable to warn us against what she believed were the perils of socialism.

Following the banishment of Oedipus, his two sons Eteocles and Polyneices have died leading opposite sides in Thebes's civil war, fighting each other for the throne. Queen Jocasta's brother Creon, now the ruler of Thebes, declares that Eteocles will be honored but Polyneices is to be publically shamed by refusing him burial rites. Creon declares that anyone attempting to do so will be put to death. In ancient Greece the refusal of burial rites was one of the most disrespectful acts that could have been shown to a person and their family. Antigone finds herself compelled by familial duty and disregards Creon's edict by scattering dirt across Polyneices's corpse. Creon, whose son Haemon is engaged to Antigone, finds himself torn between a personal loyalty to his family and a civic duty to punish Antigone for this crime. One of the greatest dramas from classical antiquity, ""Antigone,"" along with its Theban counterparts, ""Oedipus the King,"" and ""Oedipus at Colonus,"" established Sophocles as one of the most renowned dramatists of his era.

His uniqueness lies not only in the fact that at the young age of 19 and a half, he travelled to snow clad Himalayas from Kerala, and there he met and lived for several years with a 'real-time' yogi, Babaji, but also that he should undertake such an unusual and adventurous exploration, given his non-Hindu birth and antecedents.
The metamorphosis of Mumtaz Ali Khan into Sri 'M', a yogi with profound knowledge of the Upanishads and deep personal insights, born of first hand experiences with higher levels of consciousness is indeed a fascinating story.
Sri M was born in Tiruvananthapuram, Kerala. At the age of nineteen and a half, attracted by a strange and irresistible urge to go to the Himalayas, he left home.
At the Vyasa Cave, beyond the Himalayan shrine of Badrinath, he met his Mast S er and lived with him for three and a half years, wandering freely, the length and breadth of the snow clad Himalayan region. What he learnt from his Master Maheshwarnath Babaji, transformed his consciousness totally.
Back in the plains, he, as instructed by his Master, lived a normal life, working for a living, fulfilling his social commitments and at the same time preparing himself to teach all that he had learnt and experienced. At a signal from his Master he entered the teaching phase of his life. Today, he travels all over the world to share his experiences and knowledge.",https://www.buybooksindia.com/apprenticed-to-a-himalayan-master-a-yogi-s-autobiography-9789388754408-32290.htm,low range

In light of this conclusion, they must also exert the same type of cross chart influence in the area of relationships. With this premise, Emma Belle Donath wrote Asteroids in Synastry. Using her vast store of mythological as well as astrological lore, she tells the myths of the four major asteroids, as well as giving keyword lists and rulerships for each. In the body of the book she gives delineation of the asteroids using the most accepted forms of synastry (person A's planets in person B's chart and vice versa). In addition, she gives some of the major aspect configurations between charts, and takes a brief look at composite charts and contact cosmograms. Several example charts are used to illustrate asteroid use in this manner.

The enthralling story of Rama, the incarnation of God, who slew Ravana, the evil demon of darkness, is known to every Indian. And in the pages of history, as always, it is the version told by the victors, that lives on. The voice of the vanquished remains lost in silence. But what if Ravana and his people had a different story to tell? The story of the Ravanayana had never been told. Asura is the epic tale of the vanquished Asura people, a story that has been cherished by the oppressed outcastes of India for 3000 years. Until now, no Asura has dared to tell the tale. But perhaps the time has come for the dead and the defeated to speak. ñFor thousands of years, I have been vilified and my death is celebrated year after year in every corner of India. Why? Was it because I challenged the Gods for the sake of my daughter? Was it because I freed a race from the yoke of caste-based Deva rule? You have heard the victor's tale, the Ramayana. Now hear the Ravanayana, for I am Ravana, the Asura, and my story is the tale of the vanquished.î ñI am a non-entity ? invisible, powerless and negligible. No epics will ever be written about me. I have suffered both Ravana and Rama ? the hero and the villain or the villain and the hero. When the stories of great men are told, my voice maybe too feeble to be heard. Yet, spare me a moment and hear my story, for I am Bhadra, the Asura, and my life is the tale of the loser.î The ancient Asura empire lay shattered into many warring petty kingdoms reeling under the heel of the Devas. In desperation, the Asuras look up to a young saviour ? Ravana. Believing that a better world awaits them under Ravana, common men like Bhadra decide to follow the young leader. With a will of iron and a fiery ambition to succeed, Ravana leads his people from victory to victory and carves out a vast empire from the Devas. But even when Ravana succeeds spectacularly, the poor Asuras find that nothing much has changed for them. It is when that Ravana, by one action, changes the history of the world.",https://www.buybooksindia.com/asura-tale-of-the-vanquished-the-story-of-ravana-and-his-people-9789381576052-12357.htm,low range

Instead she threw herself into building a culinary empire from her restaurant, Aunty Lee’s Delights, where spicy Singaporean home cooking is graciously served by Rosie Lee herself to locals and tourists alike. But when a body is found in one of Singapore’s beautiful tourist havens, and when one of her wealthy guests fails to show at a dinner party, Aunty Lee knows that the two are likely connected. The murder and disappearance throws together Aunty Lee’s henpecked stepson Mark, his social-climbing wife Selina, a gay couple whose love is still illegal in Singapore, and an elderly Australian tourist couple whose visit—billed at first as a pleasure cruise—may mask a deeper purpose. Investigating the murder is rookie Police Commissioner Raja, who quickly discovers that the savvy and well-connected Aunty Lee can track down clues even better than local law enforcement. Wise, witty and unusually charming, Aunty Lee’s Delights is a spicy mystery about love, friendship and home cooking in Singapore, where money flows freely and people of many religions and ethnicities co-exist peacefully, but where tensions lurk just below the surface, sometimes with deadly results",https://www.buybooksindia.com/aunty-lee-s-delights-9780062227157-77096.htm,mid range

The tiny kingdom of Gorkha is on the ascendant under its ruler Prithvi Narayan Shah. Over the next few decades, his Gorkhali army establishes a mighty kingdom, the borders of which extend from Kangra in the west to the Teesta river in the east. The territory encompasses a large part of present-day Himachal Pradesh, Uttarakhand and almost all of present-day Nepal and Sikkim. When they are eventually reined in by the mighty British army in 1815, it sparks off a new engagement between the imperial power and Nepal. Impressed by the fighting abilities on display, the British army begins recruiting them. The Gurkhas (the prevalent spelling today) go on to serve with distinction in many theatres of war over the next hundred-odd years, their exploits in World War I and II earning them a number of bravery medals. With Indian independence in 1947 comes further change: the Gurkhas are now split across three armies: the British, Indian and the Nepalese. Ayo Gorkhali by Tim I. Gurung, a former British Gurkha, is the first work of history by a member of the community and brings alive the story of a people who have served flags other than their own with honour, even as they have attempted to keep their native warrior traditions alive in letter and spirit. The history of the Gurkha serviceman is one that goes beyond soldiering and bravery—it is in equal measure a story of the resilient human spirit, and of a tiny community that carved for itself a niche in world history.",https://www.buybooksindia.com/ayo-gorkhali-a-history-of-the-gurkhas-9789389648706-9031.htm,low range

Ltd.,2016,Available,824,Same Day Dispatch,English,825,Hardcover,https://cms.buybooksindia.com/uploads/books/9788184303575.jpg,"AyodhyÃ£This work of monumental research is atreatise on AyodhyÃ£ with utmost authenticity and absolute accuracy. Based on original sources and scientific investigation it propounds a new thesis, which demolishes many popular perceptions. It exonerates the intrepid warrior Babur from the charge of demolishing a temple on the birth-site ofRÃ£ma and constructing the mosque which has been a source of contention and dissension for long. It further shows how inscriptions in the mosque were factitious and Mir Baqi of inscriptions is a fictitious person different from Baqi Tashkindi/Shegawal of the Baburnama.The book produces incontrovertible evidence which indubitably proves that there existed a RÃ£ma temple on the RÃ£majanmabhÃ¹mi.The exact birthplace ofRÃ£ma was earmarked by a rectangularBedi measuring 18 ft. 9 inches in length and 15ft. in width and was located in the inner portion of the disputed shrine. The demolition of the temple and the construction of the mosque did not take place in 1528 A.D. but in c. 1660 A.D.when Fedai Khan was the Governor of Aurangzeb at AyodhyÃ£. It is a historical fact that until the British takeover ofAwadh administration in 1858 both the Hindus and Muslims used to perform puja and offer Namaz respectively inside it.All Mughal Emperors from Babur to Shah Jahan were magnanimous and liberal rulers and the BairÃ£gÃ¬s of AyodhyÃ£ enjoyed patronage of the first four Nawabs ofAwadh. However, during the long rule of Aurangzeb the country was engulfed in the fire of fanaticism. It has been shown in this book how an absolutely unfounded rumour in 1855 A.D. that the Hanumangarhitemple was constructed on the site of amosque created cleavage between the twocommunitiesand the resultant festering wounds have not healed despite best-efforts by saner elements of both thecommunities.The book exposes many eminent historiansâ€™ hypocrisy and their lack of certitude in writing history and it may be said that their presentation of contrived history on Ayodhya has caused irreparable damage to the cause of harmonizing communal relations in the country. In contrast, this text earnestly tries to takeaway the toxin from the polluted body of Indian politics. For the first time a number of unexplored documents have been incorporated in this book as evidenceandit may be proclaimed with pride that this book contains much more information onAyodhya than available hitherto. Justice G.B. Patnaik, a former Chief Justice of India, after going through the manuscript, has endorsed the author's thesis in his Foreword.

These emotions have dominated our emotional space, and hardly enable us to feel our own love. So today, we rely on someone else to love us. This book teaches us to think right, enable self-love, feel it and extend it to other people. The central message here is that love is not ?out there?, but within us. A spectrum of emotions like attachment, expectations, hurt, worry, stress, fear or anger, which we use in the pretext of love, are analysed. The conversations also explore the fact that the parent-child relationship is not challenging ? It does not need to be. As you free yourself from judgments and expectations, as you start thinking right for people, and as you accept people for who they are, you become a Radiator of unconditional love. You are one decision away from vibrating at a frequency of love ? by not needing love or giving love ? but just by being love.",https://www.buybooksindia.com/being-love-creating-beautiful-relationships-9789389143874-50938.htm,low range

Across class, religion, occupation and preoccupation, Kittur is mapped through the beauty of the rural, coastal south.

K. Mullarpattan, Maharaj's interpreter for the longest time. These tapes contained recordings of some of Maharaj's talks with seekers, held during the last two years of his life. They capture afresh the essence and flavour of the teachings of this world-renowned Master of Advaita - the Hindu philosophy of Non-duality. These dialogues find a new relevance for our times. For, in one of these talks, Maharaj made a special reference to his earlier book I Am That and said, ""That book and whatever was expounded at that time was only relevant for that period. I am speaking differently today. As a matter of fact, this should also have been recorded and published as it is in greater detail, and is emphasizing different aspects.""

In Beyond Good and Evil, Nietzsche accuses past philosophers of lacking critical sense and blindly accepting dogmatic premises in their consideration of morality. Specifically, he accuses them of founding grand metaphysical systems upon the faith that the good man is the opposite of the evil man, rather than just a different expression of the same basic impulses that find more direct expression in the evil man. The work moves into the realm ""beyond good and evil"" in the sense of leaving behind the traditional morality which Nietzsche subjects to a destructive critique in favor of what he regards as an affirmative approach that fearlessly confronts the perspectival nature of knowledge and the perilous condition of the modern individual. The work consists of 296 numbered sections and an ""epode"" (or ""aftersong"") entitled ""From High Mountains"".

Howard was originally published in 1935 and we are now republishing it with a brand new introductory biography. 'Beyond the Black River' is a story in the Conan series in which he battles the Hyborian Picts in the unsettled lands beyond the Black River. Robert Ervin Howard was born in Peaster, Texas in 1906. During his youth, his family moved between a variety of Texan boomtowns, and Howard - a bookish and somewhat introverted child - was steeped in the violent myths and legends of the Old South. At fifteen Howard began to read the pulp magazines of the day, and to write more seriously. The December 1922 issue of his high school newspaper featured two of his stories, 'Golden Hope Christmas' and 'West is West'. In 1924 he sold his first piece - a short caveman tale titled 'Spear and Fang' - for $16 to the not-yet-famous Weird Tales magazine. Howard's most famous character, Conan the Cimmerian, was a barbarian-turned-King during the Hyborian Age, a mythical period of some 12,000 years ago. Conan featured in seventeen Weird Tales stories between 1933 and 1936 which is why Howard is now regarded as having spawned the 'sword and sorcery' genre. The Conan stories have since been adapted many times, most famously in the series of films starring Arnold Schwarzenegger.",https://www.buybooksindia.com/beyond-the-black-river-9781473322592-37016.htm,low range

The reader will be taken on a journey toward a doorway that opens a life of expanded opportunities and potential successes. The book does not require a leap of faith. The principles and techniques presented herein are both practical and well documented by modern science. The following is an eloquent description and summary of this book. ""There is a musical form termed Â“call and responseÂ” in which a distinct phrase is played by one musician and a second phrase forms a commentary on or a response to the first phrase. This mirrors a tradition characteristic of African and African American Christian worship in which the speaker makes a statement and the congregation responds with an affirmation, amplifying and clarifying the initial statement. This work by Murphy and Jensen is an exquisite example of call and responseÂ—Murphy asserts, Jensen elucidates. Their subject matter may have sometimes been dismissed as too far out or not based on verifiable scientific evidence, but in page after page the call is a clear, declaratory statement of conviction and the response is an offering of anecdotal evidence which becomes increasingly compelling as the chapters accumulate. If it is not enough to convince the skeptic, it is at least enough to shake the certainty and smugness of its critics. Read this and sing!Â”Â—Daniel K.

Estimates vary from 10 per cent to 20 per cent of our GDP. Conservatively, Rs. 15 lakh crore (10 per cent of Rs. 150 lakh crore, our GDP in 2016-17).
As for Indian money in tax havens around the world? Around Rs. 65 lakh crores. Truly astounding figures.
Black money or kala dhan is a topic that has elicited much debate in recent times. The debate has been mostly marked by mud-slinging and name-calling and the discussions that have ensued often have no basis in fact. While most people have a hazy notion of black money, only a few understand it in its entirety.
The issue of tax havens is perhaps even more misunderstood. Most people fail to see the connection between tax havens and black money. Black Money and Tax Havens is the first work that discusses both of these issues in depth and offers a 360-degree view to the reader.
In this work, Prof. R. Vaidyanathan provides the reader with a brief overview of black money—its generation, its estimates and how and why it is spirited away to tax havens. He also lays bare the danger that is posed to world financial well-being on account of the lack of political will to tackle them.

Howard was originally published in 1938 and we are now republishing it with a brand new introductory biography. 'Black Vulmea's Vengeance' is a story in the Black Vulmea series about an Irish pirate sailing the Caribbean. Robert Ervin Howard was born in Peaster, Texas in 1906. During his youth, his family moved between a variety of Texan boomtowns, and Howard - a bookish and somewhat introverted child - was steeped in the violent myths and legends of the Old South. At fifteen Howard began to read the pulp magazines of the day, and to write more seriously. The December 1922 issue of his high school newspaper featured two of his stories, 'Golden Hope Christmas' and 'West is West'. In 1924 he sold his first piece - a short caveman tale titled 'Spear and Fang' - for $16 to the not-yet-famous Weird Tales magazine. Howard's most famous character, Conan the Cimmerian, was a barbarian-turned-King during the Hyborian Age, a mythical period of some 12,000 years ago. Conan featured in seventeen Weird Tales stories between 1933 and 1936 which is why Howard is now regarded as having spawned the 'sword and sorcery' genre. The Conan stories have since been adapted many times, most famously in the series of films starring Arnold Schwarzenegger",https://www.buybooksindia.com/black-vulmea-s-vengeance-9781473322639-40930.htm,low range

In this freewheeling history of modern Britain, Cathy Newman writes about the pioneering women who defied the odds to make careers for themselves and alter the course of modern history; women who achieved what they achieved while dismantling hostile, entrenched views about their place in society. Their role in transforming Britain is fundamental, far greater than has generally been acknowledged, and not just in the arts or education but in fields like medicine, politics, law, engineering and the military. While a few of the women in this book are now household names, many have faded into oblivion, their personal and collective achievements mere footnotes in history. We know of Emmeline Pankhurst, Vera Brittain, Marie Stopes and Beatrice Webb. But who remembers engineer and motorbike racer Beatrice Shilling, whose ingenious device for the Spitfiresâ€™ Rolls-Royce Merlin fixed an often-fatal flaw, allowing the RAFâ€™s planes to beat the German in the Battle of Britain? Or Dorothy Lawrence, the journalist who achieved her ambition to become a WW1 correspondent by pretending to be a man? And developmental biologist Anne McLaren, whose work in genetics paved the way for in vitro fertilisation? Blending meticulous research with information gleaned from memoirs, diaries, letters, novels and other secondary sources, Bloody Brilliant Women uses the stories of some extraordinary lives to tell the tale of 20th and 21st century Britain.

Parallel to her story, is the narrative of a land that is struggling to assert its identity and moving towards a hard-won Independence in a crucible of blood and tears. Mehr is the symbol of the land. Her suffering, her distress, her tortured anguish, is an emblem of its agony, in particular of the women of the country, as it is being birthed.

Knowing the hints, clues, signals, and signs that people use in business and social settings helps people to interpret behavioral motives, and enables them to rapidly organize information for quick decisions that may be consequential. In addition, facial expressions, posture, dress attire, and gestures that people use all infer future behavior patterns. In this book, body language signals and signs are broken down into understandable topics backed by authoritative sources. Practical pointers help readers to adopt better image and self-presentation skills.

Written with an abiding humanity, Mahari's characters are portrayed as complex and flawed - neither hero nor villain but keenly observed and evoked with a tender humour. Burning Orchards offers a version of events leading up to the siege of Van different from the received, politically charged accounts, even daring to reflect something of the loyalty many Ottoman Armenians had felt towards the former Empire. First published in Armenian in 1966 after Mahari's long exile in Siberian, Burning Orchards (Ayrvogh Aygestanner), was banned and publicly burned in the streets of Yerevan, even though the authorities in Moscow had eventually agreed to its publication. Much against the wishes of his wife he tried to rewrite the novel, removing passages criticising some Armenian political parties and leaders, but dying before it could be finalised.

It is easy to blame governments and lawmakers, but Robert Kiyosaki in his book, The Business of The 21st Century, asks people to change the state of affairs themselves. Robert Kiyosaki says that it is possible to create alternate streams of income that secure financial stability even in grave times. Kiyosaki puts forth the idea of network-marketing as a great way of creating alternate streams of passive income. Passive income, he says, is the income that keeps flowing in even when you're not working. He urges people to set up ventures that would allow them to avail the benefits of passive income. He says that this is possible with a good business model and dedicating enough effort in the early stages of the venture. With network-marketing, one can establish a business network with other, similar-minded entrepreneurs. The Business of The 21st Century postulates that network marketing allows you to harness the potential of an entire network. The book was first published in 2012 by Manjul and is available as a paperback.",https://www.buybooksindia.com/business-of-the-21st-century-the-9788183222600-50544.htm,low range

Call Girl Confidential is Rebecca Kadeâ€™s compelling, intimate account of her career as an escort...and her work as an undercover agent for the Manhattan District Attorneyâ€™s Office. Strictly raised as a Southern Baptist, Rebecca Kade never dreamed she would compromise her values by someday becoming a high-priced escort. But when her rock star former lover took her to court in a drawn-out custody battle for their daughter, Rebeccaâ€™s legit day job barely covered her exorbitant legal fees.

After settling in England around the turn of the century, Sabatini decided to try his hand as a writer, a decision that paid off handsomely in a series of widely acclaimed historical novels, several of which became equally popular cinematic adaptations.
Captain Blood is the story of Peter Blood, a soldier-turned-doctor who is wrongly accused of treason during the 1685 Monmouth Rebellion, narrowly escapes death at the Bloody Assize, and is sent as a slave to Barbados, where he is bought by (and falls in love with) beautiful Arabella, niece to the bestial planter Colonel Bishop. A Spanish attack on the island gives Blood the chance to capture the Spaniard's vessel and sail off to a life of freedom and piracy on the Spanish Main, an avocation that eminently suits his brave, free-spirited temperament and leads him to become the renowned 'Captain Blood', celebrated for courtesy and fair-dealing with friend and foe alike. But all his fame and riches mean nothing, for his heart remains set on Arabella, and she will never love a thief and pirate.
Sabatini's riveting historical novel remains in a class of its own: a well-researched, swashbuckling pirate adventure that is as inconstant as the sea itself, rocking the reader between treachery and loyalty, cruelty and kindness, implacable hatred and undying love.",https://www.buybooksindia.com/captain-blood-9781911405238-59741.htm,low range

The establishment and running of businesses tap into caste networks, both in terms of arranging finance and providing access to a ready workforce.
By and large, caste has only been studied from a religious, social and political angle. Though it is widely accepted that caste has economic ramifications, any study of this aspect has been limited to looking at caste groups in terms of their per capita income, their representation in various professions, and other statistical details.
Caste as Social Capital examines the workings of caste through the lens of business, economics and entrepreneurship. It interrogates the role caste plays in the economic sphere in terms of facilitating the nuts and bolts of business and entrepreneurship: finance, markets and workforce. Through this qualitative view of caste, an entirely new picture emerges of caste which forces one to view this age-old institution in new light.",https://www.buybooksindia.com/caste-as-social-capital-9789388689113-33231.htm,low range

The novel has two parts. In the first part, it takes readers to ancient India where a simple but extraordinarily smart Brahmin helps an Indian ruler to combat 'Alexander, the great'; while the second half is set in contemporary India. This book is written by famous historical fiction author Ashwin Sanghi who is known for his minute detailing and charming story telling style. It is published by Westland publication and within two months, it became an Indian national bestseller. This book received the 2010 Vodafone-Crossword Popular Choice Award.
India during 340 BC was a land divided between numerous regional rulers who had limited power and were no match for their foreign counterparts. Alexander the great, in his quest of conquering the world, reaches the Indian frontier and the Indian rulers are set to bend their knees in front of this great ruler. However, one ruler, Chandragupta Maurya provides resistance and is successful in stopping Alexander’s invasion and establishes the mighty Mauryan Dynasty. How did the petty ruler with a tiny kingdom pulled off a victory against Alexander?
It is the brain of Chankaya, the smart political strategist which helps Chandragupta in his conquest. Chankaya with his shrewd tactics and unbelievable brilliance becomes the most powerful political strategist the land had ever seen. They say that history repeats itself and now, Chankaya is born again, two and a half millennia later in modern India as Gangasagar Mishra. Being a Brahmin teacher, he has the same dream to become the most powerful person of this country. However, this time his challenges are bigger than before.
India has adopted a democratic system but Gangasagar Mishra is optimistic of conning the system through greed, corruption, venality and sexual deviance. On his side is an ambitious, beautiful and a powerful slum child. Will Chankaya be successful this time?",https://www.buybooksindia.com/chanakya-s-chant--9789381626818-24.htm,low range

A hunted, haunted Brahmin youth vows revenge for the gruesome murder of his beloved father. Cold, calculating, cruel and armed with a complete absence of accepted morals, he becomes the most powerful political strategist in Bharat and succeeds in uniting a ragged country against the invasion of the army of that demigod, Alexander the Great. Pitting the weak edges of both forces against each other, he pulls off a wicked and astonishing victory and succeeds in installing Chandragupta on the throne of the mighty Mauryan empire.
History knows him as the brilliant strategist Chanakya. Satisfied-and a little bored-by his success as a kingmaker, through the simple summoning of his gifted mind, he recedes into the shadows to write his Arthashastra, the 'science of wealth'. But history, which exults in repeating itself, revives Chanakya two and a half millennia later, in the avatar of Gangasagar Mishra, a Brahmin teacher in smalltown India who becomes puppeteer to a host of ambitious individuals-including a certain slumchild who grows up into a beautiful and powerful woman.
Modern India happens to be just as riven as ancient Bharat by class hatred, corruption and divisive politics and this landscape is Gangasagar's feasting ground. Can this wily pandit-who preys on greed, venality and sexual deviance-bring about another miracle of a united India? Will Chanakya's chant work again? Ashwin Sanghi, the bestselling author of The Rozabal Line, brings you yet another historical spinechiller.",https://www.buybooksindia.com/chanakya-s-chant-bharat-series-2-9789356292277-75184.htm,low range

• Are the elites of ‘Lutyen’s Delhi’ stuck in a time warp?
• Should India call Pakistan’s bluff and brand it an enemy nation?
• Why do MPs disrupt parliament and waste the taxpayers’ money?
• Why shouldn’t a grand Ram temple be built in Ayodhya?
• Why is India’s foreign policy more ad-hocism and less strategy?
In Chanakya’s View: Understanding India in Transition, Pavan K. Varma, best-selling author of Adi Shankaracharya: Hinduism’s Greatest Thinker, analyses the challenges that India faces today. In a minute and frank critique, he points to behavioral change as the need of the hour: Indians need to respect institutions, shun intolerance, accommodate dissent, follow strategic diplomacy and increase their moral quotient. At once a celebration of India and an appraisal of it, Chanakya’s View is a roadmap to making the republic a truly great one.
One of India’s foremost public intellectuals, and also a politician, Varma firmly believes that India will sustain itself owing to its great civilizational heritage and the strength of its people. As a committed admirer of the great strategist Chanakya, he is convinced that these years of transition will ultimately lead to a maturation worthy of the world’s largest democracy.",https://www.buybooksindia.com/chanakya-s-view-india-in-transition-9789388689526-33379.htm,low range

The 19th century England was prodigious for the production of novels with such luminaries as William Makepeace Thackeray, Charles Dickens, the famous Bronte sisters Charlotte Bronte, Anne Bronte and Emily Bronte George Eliot and Thomas Hardy adorning the horizon. Among these, Dickens certainly holds a pride of place: his prodigious writings, predominantly novels, and his inimitable style bear testimony to this. The child figure is ubiquitous in all his novels from Oliver Twist, Dombey and Son to Hard Times and Great Expectations. The child is sometimes the victim and sometimes the reminder of the innocence lost in a materialistic world. Great Expectations is a fascinating novel told with remarkable drama, humour and irony. It is a gripping story, the story of Pip, the orphan boy adopted by Mr. Joe Gragery, a blacksmith. Pip has both good luck and great expectations; but then he loses both. Through his rise and fall, Pip learns how to find happiness and, in the process, falls in love. Pip is neither a hero nor an antihero. He is just an ordinary human being who experiences myriad emotions fright, love, grief, misery and happiness. As in his other novels, Dickens draws memorable and haunting characters in this novel, too, and also exposes the rampant corruption prevalent during the period. Besides a comprehensive Preface by the Editor, the book gives the actual text, followed by specially written critical essays on the novel by experts in the field, each offering insights on different aspects of narrative, themes and culture. Undergraduate and postgraduate students of English Literature as well as researchers in the field should find this book extremely useful and immensely readable.",https://www.buybooksindia.com/charles-dickens-great-expectations-9788120338135-48728.htm,low range

The immaculately dressed Chowringhee, radiant in her youth, had just stepped on to the floor at the nightclub.â€™ Set in 1950s Calcutta, Chowringhee is a sprawling saga of the intimate lives of managers, employees and guests at one of Calcuttaâ€™s largest hotels, the Shahjahan. Shankar, the newest recruit, recounts the stories of several people whose lives come together in the suites, restaurants, bar and backrooms of the hotel. As both observer and participant in the events, he inadvertently peels off the layers of everyday existence to expose the seamy underbelly of unfulfilled desires, broken dreams, callous manipulation and unbidden tragedy. What unfolds is not just the story of individual lives but also the incredible chronicle of a metropolis. Written by best-selling Bengali author Sankar, Chowringhee was published as a novel in 1962. Predating Arthur Haileyâ€™s Hotel by three years, it became an instant hit, spawning translations in major Indian languages, a film and a play. Its larger-than-life charactersâ€”the enigmatic manager Marco Polo, the debonair receptionist Sata Bose, the tragic hostess Karabi Guha, among othersâ€”soon attained cult status. With its thinly veiled accounts of the private lives of real-life celebrities, and its sympathetic narrative seamlessly weaving the past and the present, it immediately established itself as a popular classic.

There is a strong possibility for all three, and in that order, says Surjit S. Bhalla in Citizen Raj: Indian Elections 1952–2019.
The Congress in Election 2019: Will the Rahul Gandhi-led Indian National Congress emerge as the single largest Opposition party; or will it become irrelevant and be relegated to electoral history? Most likely, and in the same order, infers the author.
But this is not a book about Elections 2019. It is the most definitive account of the history of Indian elections, chronicling the political and economic background against which it has been unfolding since 1952: the hegemony of the Congress party for close to six decades, and why the ‘dynasts’ control it; the ignominious end of Janata Party in the 1970s; the economic reforms of 1991; rise of the Right-wing BJP in the early 1980s, and most importantly, the way India ceded space to a man called Narendra Modi.
Citizen Raj cautions readers that the BJP needs corrective action and to immediately move away from its cow politics; even as the Rahul Gandhi-led Congress party, and the Mahagathbandhan (an alliance of regional parties) need to move away from an outdated social and economic narrative to become worthy of a nation which is fast discarding identity and caste politics to emerge as a modern middle-class economic power. Brutally honest, deeply incisive and backed by in-depth research and data, this is essential reading for everyone interested in India’s political and economic future—no matter which side of the political divide they stand on.",https://www.buybooksindia.com/citizen-raj-indian-elections-1952-2019-9789388689120-33338.htm,low range

In this scientific detective story, an award-winning public health expert reveals what happens when an entire city's heartline is brutally severed.Despite its reputation as a carnival of vice, Tijuana was, until recent years, no more or less violent than neighboring San Diego, to which it clings across a filament of border. But then something changed. Over the past thirty years, Mexico's third-largest city became one of the world's most dangerous. Tijuana's murder rate has skyrocketed, producing a staggering number of female victims. Hundreds of women are now found dead in the city each year, or bound and mutilated along the highway that lines the Baja coast.When Dan Werb began to study these murders in 2013, rather than viewing them in isolation, he discovered that they could only be understood as one symptom among many. Environmental toxins, drug overdoses, HIV transmission: all were killing women at overwhelming rates. As an epidemiologist, trained to mine data to uncover the hidden drivers of a population's health, Werb sensed the presence of a deeper contagion targeting Tijuana's women. Not a virus, but some awful wrong buried in the city's social order, scything down its most vulnerable citizens. Werb's five-year search for the ultimate causes of Tijuana's femicide casts new light on immigration, human trafficking, addiction, and the true cost of American empire. It leads Werb from slums and drugs dens all the way to the corridors of cartel power and police corruption, as he follows a thread that finally takes a surprising turn back over the border, northward.",https://www.buybooksindia.com/city-of-omens-a-search-for-the-missing-women-of-the-borderlands-9781635572995-72623.htm,low range

‘Sets him comfortably alongside Tolkien, Rowling and David Mitchell, and he is a much more elegant writer than two of those … Cloud Cuckoo Land is an impressive achievement and a joy to read. Serious novels are rarely this fun’ The Times
Bound together by a single ancient text, the unforgettable characters of Cloud Cuckoo Land are dreamers and outsiders figuring out the world around them: thirteen-year-old Anna and Omeir, an orphaned seamstress and a cursed boy, on opposite sides of the formidable city walls during the 1453 siege of Constantinople; teenage idealist Seymour and octogenarian Zeno in an attack on a public library in present-day Idaho; and Konstance, decades from now, who turns to the oldest stories to guide her community in peril.
Doerr has created a tapestry of times and places that reflect our own vast interconnectedness – with other species, with each other, with those who lived before us and those who will be hereafter we’re gone. Dedicated to ‘the librarians then, now, and in the years to come’, Cloud Cuckoo Land is a beautiful and redemptive novel about stewardship – of the book, of the Earth, of the human heart.
‘A humane and uplifting book for adults that’s infused with the magic of childhood reading experiences.

It also examines how coaching helps leaders maintain a fine balance between managing and guiding, and between appraising and supporting their teammates. While many excellent books have been written about leadership, talent and coaching, this is a rare book that stands boldly at the intersection of leadership and coaching. This is a book for our times. Businesses are facing a new reality, characterized by a VUCA (volatile, uncertain, complex and ambiguous) world. This new reality has forced organizations to depart from conventional command-and-control practices to a completely new model - a model in which leaders support and guide, rather than instruct and control, their team members. Exploring some of the key ingredients of impactful leadership, Coaching offers tips and tricks, backed by research and incisive insights, on how to become an effective leader-coach. Peppered with interesting anecdotes and analogies, drawn from sports, performing arts and other walks of life, the book is a breezy read. Interviews with corporate leaders and academics further enrich the narrative.

Given the subtitle of ‘The Spiritual Odyssey of a Man of Science’, and very rightly so called, Code Name God strikes a perfect balance between spirituality and science to explain the deep concepts that seem to be giving shape and meaning to our lives. Is God dead? Are religion and faith merely opiates of the masses? Is science responsible for driving a wedge between man and his maker? Till about four hundred years ago, belief in divine power dominated world thought. With developments in science and increasing philosophical skepticism, man appeared to lose faith in God. But science itself has proved to be a false god, leaving in its wake a disillusioned and despondent mankind. In his book, Mani Lal Bhoumik begins his profound attempt at answering the above questions by using ingredients from the field of quantum physics amalgamated perfectly with his personal journey from rags to riches. The author explains his journey from a small town in Bengal to Bel Air during the turbulent periods, when famine had struck Bengal and amidst the chaos of the freedom struggle. His life journey deeply influenced by his father’s ideals and later by great freedom fighters like Mahatma Gandhi are dealt with, in details with a touch of spirituality and techniques like the LASIK technology. Enriching and inspirational, Code Name God provides a simple and easy-to-understand scientific approach to faith and God-realization. It has been referred to as the author’s personal odyssey by a few critics.",https://www.buybooksindia.com/code-name-god-the-spiritual-odyssey-of-a-man-of-science--9780144001033-31240.htm,low range

A friend, Renate, had told me about her trip to Vienna where she was born, and of her childhood relationships to statues. She told me stories of her childhood, her relationship to her father, her first love. I begin the novel with: Vienna was the city of statues. They were as numerous as the people who walked the streets. They stood on the top of the highest towers, law down on stone tombs, sat on horseback, kneeled, prayed, fought animals and wars, danced, drank wine and read books made of stone. They adorned cornices like the figureheads of old ships. They stood in the heart of fountains glistening with water as if they had just been born. They sat under the trees in the parks summer and winter. Some wore costumes of other periods, and some no clothes at all. Men, women, children, kings, dwarfs, gargoyles, unicorns, lions, clowns, heroes, wise men, prophets, angels, saints, and soldiers preserved for Vienna a vision of eternity. As a child Renate could see them from her bedroom window. At night, when the white muslin curtains fluttered out like ballooning wedding dresses, she heard them whispering like figures which had been petrified by a spell during the day and came alive only at night. Their silence by day taught her to read their frozen lips as one reads the messages of deaf mutes. On rainy days their granite eye sockets shed tears mixed with soot. Renate would never allow anyone to tell her the history of the statues, or to identify them. This would have situated them in the past. She was convinced that people did not die, they became statues. They were people under a spell and if she were watchful enough they would tell her who they were and how they lived now. If I had been asked then what was going to follow the description of the statues, I could not have answered. I was fascinated by the image of these many statues and of the child Renate inventing stories about them and dialoguing with them. It may have been that this image expressed the feeling I often had that people appear to us as a one-dimensional statue until we go deeper into their life story. People are like mute statues under a spell of appearance, and static, until we let them whisper their secrets. And this only happens at night. That is, when we are able to dream, imagine, and explore the unconscious. We see the external self. Because Collages took its images from painting and sculpture, I liked the idea that sculpture and painting could become animated, speaking, confessing, and then in daylight returning to their previous forms as statues or paintings. They spoke only to the artist. To me it meant dramatizing our relation to art, one feeding the other, the interrelation between human beings and the artist's conception of them. In daylight (consciousness) we catch them all only in one attitude, one form. At night, we discover their lives."" - Anais Nin, The Novel of the Future, (Athens: Ohio University Press, 1986), 128",https://www.buybooksindia.com/collages-9780804000451-41993.htm,mid range

Coming Up for Air, released in 1939, does this and is also, in the words of Orwell biographer, Bernard Crick, the ""most English of his novels."" In this first-person novel, 45-year-old George Bowling journeys back to the home of his boyhood. Bowling, who has won some money betting on horse racing, keeps the news hidden from his wife and children and decides to use the winnings to finance a trip to his childhood home. This, to Bowling, is ""coming up for air."" He has faced the unpleasant fact that a war is coming and wants to go to a tranquil place where he doesn't have to think about it for a time. He also wants a brief vacation away from his West Bletchley suburban London home's stresses: he wishes to get away from his bullying wife as well as the ceaseless pressure to earn a living. Bowling has idyllic memories of his childhood home in Lower Binfield from the period before World War I. However, when he returns, not surprisingly, everything has changed. It is not the tranquil place of fishing ponds that he remembers (his fishing pond has turned into a trash dump). The town has grown; it has a munitions plant; his childhood home has been turned into a tea shop; and his old girlfriend Elsie is now old and ugly. However, as the fat and toothless (he has false teeth) Bowling says to himself, no woman would ever look at him again unless paidâ€”an acknowledgement of his own loss of looks.",https://www.buybooksindia.com/coming-up-for-air-9789390354603-73473.htm,low range

Common Sense presented the American colonists with an argument for freedom from British rule at a time when the question of seeking independence was still undecided. Paine wrote and reasoned in a style that common people understood. Forgoing the philosophical and Latin references used by Enlightenment era writers, he structured Common Sense as if it were a sermon, and relied on Biblical references to make his case to the people.

To address this question, Dana Zartner has developed a novel cultural-institutional theory to explain the manner in which a state's domestic legal tradition shapes policy through the process of internalization. A state's legal traditionâ€•the cultural and institutional factors that shape attitudes about the law, appropriate standards of behavior, and the legal processâ€•is the key mechanism by which international law becomes recognized, accepted, and internalized in the domestic legal framework. Legal tradition shapes not only perceptions about law, but also provides the lens through which policy-makers view state interests, directly and indirectly influencing state policy. The book disaggregates the concept of legal tradition and examines how the individual cultural and institutional characteristics present within a state's domestic legal tradition facilitate or hinder the internalization of international law and, subsequently, shape state policy. In turn it explains both the differences in international law recognition across legal traditions, as well as the variance among states within legal traditions. To test this theory Zartner compares case studies within five of the main legal traditions in the world today: common law (U.S. and Australia), civil law (Germany and Turkey), Islamic law (Egypt and Saudi Arabia), mixed traditions (India and Kenya), and East Asian law (China and Japan). She addresses the differences among legal traditions as well as between states within the same tradition; the important role that legal culture and history play in shaping contemporary attitudes about law; and similarities and differences in state policy towards human rights law versus environmental law.",https://www.buybooksindia.com/courts-codes-and-custom-legal-tradition-and-state-policy-toward-international-human-rights-and-en-9780199362103-7307.htm,mid range

It will help a person pursue their ambitions and work toward all that he desires in life. But it is not easy to come by and a person has to work hard towards establishing it. It is important to follow this book as it is written, since each chapter and part builds upon the ones before it. You will start by learning about your behavior and habits, and how they develop. This allows you to craft a natural and effective plan to make changes where they are needed. Being self-disciplined implies several actions that are completely needed to build this value. You have read about having self-esteem and self-worth, being responsible, considerate, thoughtful, to practice forgiveness, being organized, being diligent, etc. This means that building self-discipline is not a hard task if you are really willing to be disciplined, but it has several things to take into account. How many good opportunities have you had and lost just because of a lack of self-discipline? Now you know that being disciplined, organized, trustworthy, and effective can be developed in easy ways. You just needed the willpower to improve your good habits and get rid of the bad ones. Now that you know more about self-discipline and how easy is to get there, you must be encouraged to have personal and professional growth based on this essential value. You learned what you could lose for not having it (and you probably already have lost something due to that), the great benefits of being self-disciplined, and that one easy way to reaching your goals is by being disciplined, how to build discipline, and what ways you increase it through common activities. The important role self-discipline plays in your life goes a long way to justify every effort and time you put into building your self-discipline. The techniques outlined in this book will guide you on this self-discipline journey to enable you to live a better and more meaningful life. The human brain is extremely complex and we are only just starting to find out its exact processes for creating and modifying learned behaviors and habits. It is hardwired to perform certain activities automatically for sure. These are initiated at birth and do not require any effort to be performed. However, it is certainly possible to train the brain in order to develop new habits with little guidance. Scientists describe this ability to rewire the neurons and synapses as 'neuroplasticity'. Habits, in general, can be of two main types namely positive/beneficial and negative/unbeneficial. Good habits help a person develop self-discipline and increase productivity whereas bad habits can undo all of it and decrease productivity. It is therefore extremely important for a person to assess their day-to-day behaviors and habits and to reduce the 'bad' habits whilst amplifying the 'good' habits. Read this guide for more on how to develop self-discipline, the impacts and how to deal with setbacks and obstacles. Let me ask you, would you tell a good friend or family member the same thing if you were to see them cheat on their diet? Or saw them scrolling through their social media feed when they said they were going to be studying? If you are a good friend you would gently remind them but only if they asked you to beforehand. No, you would be kind to them. So why can't we be the same way to ourselves",https://www.buybooksindia.com/daily-self-discipline-9783950485486-65166.htm,low range

And when the boundary between the two is crossed, the consequences can be unpredictable. There in Goa, while roaming the beaches with a band of hippies, Alec, an up-and-coming English lawyer, meets Anu, the daughter of a prominent Hindu landowner, who is yearning for the freedom of choice. Their marriage sets in motion a chain of events that culminates eighteen years later when Ronnie comes to Goa to visit the beach where his mother was lost in the sea and meets Meera, a young girl â€“ whose mother is also dead â€“ living with her grandparents; all three of whom are being ostracised by the community. And watching over them is Maushiâ€”Anuâ€™s mother and Meeraâ€™s grandmother.

Volcanic eruptions create land and produce nutrient-rich soil, but they can also bury entire towns under lava and debris. The very forces that create and recycle Earth's crust also spawn destructive earthquakes and tsunamis. Water and wind spread life, but in hurricanes they can leave devastation in their wake.
Today, we know more than ever before about the powerful forces that can cause catastrophe, but significant questions remain. Why can't we better predict some natural disasters? What do scientists know about them already? What do they wish they knew?

We need both success and failure to find our rainbow. The ability to grasp this rainbow during the journey is true success. Failure often talks in a dumb language, which people canâ€™t understand easily; otherwise, the same mistakes canâ€™t be repeated. The calm which puts us to sleep is more fatal than the storm which keeps us awake. Nothing worthwhile is achieved without struggle; otherwise, everybody will achieve it, if it is so easy. What we are today at this time keeps changing every minute, every second. Past failures should be the guidelines for future success. Until you try, you don't know what you canâ€™t do. The aim of education must be to teach a person how to bring out the best in him and to develop himself to his greatest potential. But the purpose of education nowadays seems to be only getting a job. We sow our character and we reap our destiny. There is no right way to do a wrong thing. If one continues to do what he is doing, he will always get what he already got. Successful people may fail but the important thing is that they never give up. It is the ability to climb up again after the fall that matters. Nothing in the world can take its placeâ€”talent will not, genius will not, education will not. Persistence and determination alone are omnipotent. People donâ€™t fail, but they quit in the middle. Without deviation, progress is not possible. For every problem under the sun, there is a remedy or there is none. If there is a remedy, try it otherwise why worry about it! The sweet smell of success has little meaning without fail. He who is a bankrupt is not the one who doesnâ€™t have a cent in his pocket, but the person who doesnâ€™t have a dream. Failure doesnâ€™t mean God has abandoned you. It means God has a better idea. Failure is never final. It is impossible to find a person who has not tasted failure. Nobody learns from success, but learns from failures and mistakes. Author Billi Lim is from a very poor family that has fourteen children. In the book he has also shared his personal problems and how he overcomes them. On the whole - this is the book for those who hate to fail",https://www.buybooksindia.com/dare-to-fail-a-book-for-those-who-hate-to-fail-9789380494555-17713.htm,low range

In a powerful new vision Dr BrenÃ© Brown challenges everything we think we know about vulnerability, and dispels the widely accepted myth that it's a weakness. She argues that, in truth, vulnerability is strength and when we shut ourselves off from vulnerability - from revealing our true selves - we distance ourselves from the experiences that bring purpose and meaning to our lives.

There are several steps in this night, which are related in successive stanzas. The narrative explains the painful experience that people endure as they seek to grow in spiritual maturity and union with God. This fine translation by E.

And after many years of running the high-volume, low-margin Udupi restaurant handed down to him by his late father, Jigar has in middle age decided to set himself a new challenge: Chinese! After all, Indians love Chinese food more than the Chinese themselves â€“ and in this new world of cleavers and bamboo steamers, black bean sauce and drunken chicken, wok chi and the holy Tao, chopsticks and the songs of Teresa teng, there will be new customers, new stories, new happiness. A whole new Bombay can be made within the walls of the China dragon. But Jigar has taken on more than he has reckoned for. Beyond the hazards of empty hours, capricious chefs and flailing waiters, there are the customers who bring him not just their appetites but their problems. But even as losses Mount and the China dragon totters, there remain the small, warming pleasures of the parade of faces and figures at the tables, the nuances of taste and temperament, the jokes that banish dullness and the situations that make time hum and sing, the freedom of being Indians who have never left India and must yet inhabit and interpret another culture. As Jigar sees it, a restaurant is the greatest of lifeâ€™s theatres, for human beings are never more themselves than in their encounters with food. Days of My China dragon offers an insight not just into the restaurant trade, but also a little history of modern Indian life seen from behind the counter of a shop in prabhadevi. Once you have absorbed the spirit of the China dragon, dear reader, you will always be hungry for life and food.

Trust formed the unshakeable foundation of the doctor-patient relationship and, for long, doctors were treated next to God. In recent times, though, this sacred relationship is suffering from an erosion of faith. We often hear discouraging stories of doctors being abused and hospitals vandalised. The narrative is gradually turning negative-a dismal reality for both doctors and patients. We tend to forget that there are many great things happening in the medical world. Today, we are living much longer, we have managed to eradicate many diseases, we have vaccines that prevent our children from dying, life-saving surgeries are being performed while the baby is still in the womb, and we can give the gift of life to someone by transplanting vital organs. Medical miracles are happening every day in hospitals worldwide.This book is a collection of heartfelt stories by doctors and patients from across the globe. These are stories of triumph, empathy, positivity, loss and, sometimes, failure. It goes one step ahead and captures the experience of people who surround a doctor-the mother of a doctor, a surgeon's husband and an acid attack survivor-stories that underline that a doctor too is a human being after all. Human resilience can often break barriers, and these stories serve as inspiration to both patients and doctors alike.Riveting and absolutely unputdownable, Dear People gives an inside view of the world of medicine and hopes to inspire millions to retain faith in this beautiful relationship.",https://www.buybooksindia.com/dear-people-with-love-and-care-your-doctors-9789387146945-74344.htm,low range

In April 2003, twenty-one-year-old Tom Hurndall, an English photojournalism student, was shot in the head as he carried a Palestinian child out of the range of an Israeli army sniper in the town of Rafah in the Gaza Strip. Tom was unarmed, and wearing the internationally recognised peaceworker's fluorescent orange jacket. Severely wounded, he never recovered consciousness and died nine months later in a London hospital. A year after his death, following the family's own investigation and their determined and impartial fight to see justice done after a cover-up by the Israeli Defence Force, a soldier was sentenced to eight years for Tom's manslaughter. It was an unprecedented outcome, and a case that made legal history in bringing the IDF to account for its killing of an unarmed civilian. Tom's mother tells the story of this courageous young Englishman's quest, of its tragic end and its effect on his family. Defy the Stars is an elegy for a son, a story of loss but also of hope, for out of the tragedy have come projects in Gaza and friendships with both peace-loving Palestinians and Israelis. Her moving book gives a vivid picture of the realities of day-to-day life in Israel and in the bleak and beleaguered towns of the Gaza Strip and the West Bank. It puts a human face to a situation that affects us all, and speaks for the plight of countless forgotten people in the Middle East who suffer such losses on a daily basis.",https://www.buybooksindia.com/defy-the-stars--9780747589440-10833.htm,low range

Simultaneously nostalgic and unflinching, evocative and savage, Delhi: A Soliloquy does the impossible, and makes me want to visit New Delhi again. Mukundan is a writer of immense power and refinement.’—Aravind Adiga, author of The White Tiger
It is the 1960s. Delhi is a city of refugees and dire poverty. The Malayali community is just beginning to lay down roots, and the government offices at Central Secretariat, as well as hospitals across the city, are infused with Malayali-ness. This is the Delhi young Sahadevan makes his home, with the help of Shreedharanunni, committed trade union leader and lover of all things Chinese.
Then, unexpectedly, China declares war on India. In a moment, all is split asunder, including Shreedharanunni’s family. Their battle to survive is mirrored in the lives of many others: firebrand journalist Kunhikrishnan and his wife Lalitha; maverick artist Vasu; call girl and inveterate romantic Rosily; JNU student and activist Janakikutty. As India tumbles from one crisis to another—the Indo-Pak War, the refugee influx of the 1970s, the Emergency and its excesses, the riots of 1984—Sahadevan is everywhere, walking, soliloquising and aching to capture it all, the adversities and the happiness.

Based on an actual event involving the murder of a revolutionary by his comrades, this novel depicts a band of ruthless radicals attempting to incite revolt in their small, rural community. At the center of ""Demons"" lies Dostoyevsky's desire to protest the enthusiasm for revolution he saw all around him, as well as the conservative establishment's inability to cope with those revolutionary ideas or their consequences. The author considered utopias unobtainable, and he depicts the radicals and the ideas they represent with a frightening savage intensity, as if they were possessed by demons rather than those unrealistic ideas.

Debraj Ray, one of the most accomplished theorists in development economics today, presents in this book a synthesis of recent and older literature in the field and raises important questions that will help to set the agenda for future research. He covers such vital subjects as theories of economic growth, economic inequality, poverty and undernutrition, population growth, trade policy, and the markets for land, labor, and credit. A common point of view underlies the treatment of these subjects: that much of the development process can be understood by studying factors that impede the efficient and equitable functioning of markets. Diverse topics such as the new growth theory, moral hazard in land contracts, information-based theories of credit markets, and the macroeconomic implications of economic inequality come under this common methodological umbrella. The book takes the position that there is no single cause for economic progress, but that a combination of factors--among them the improvement of physical and human capital, the reduction of inequality, and institutions that enable the background flow of information essential to market performance--consistently favor development. Ray supports his arguments throughout with examples from around the world. The book assumes a knowledge of only introductory economics and explains sophisticated concepts in simple, direct language, keeping the use of mathematics to a minimum. Development Economics will be the definitive textbook in this subject for years to come. It will prove useful to researchers by showing intriguing connections among a wide variety of subjects that are rarely discussed together in the same book. And it will be an important resource for policy-makers, who increasingly find themselves dealing with complex issues of growth, inequality, poverty, and social welfare.",https://www.buybooksindia.com/development-economics-9780195649000-30309.htm,low range

What follows is an elongated and witty brain-game between the investigator and her accomplice, Ishigami, who aided Yasuko in covering up the murder. The Devotion Of Suspect X is the story about an ingenious plotter, and clever Dr Manabu Yukawa, who helps in solving the case. Yasuko Hanaoka works in a restaurant. She is divorced, and is a single mother to Misato. Her ex-husband, Togashi, was an abusive man, stalking and extorting money from her. With similar intentions, he showed up at Yasukoâ€™s home, this time threatening to kill her and her daughter if she refused to lend him money. What started from denial, reached to a heated argument, and within a short span of time, turned to a nasty fight. In the spur of the moment, Yasuko killed Togashi. Hearing the commotion in their apartment, Tetsuya Ishigami came into the picture. Ishigami was a middle-aged, single math teacher, who evidently had a growing affection for Yasuko. He offered not only to help her dispose of the corpse, but also to devise a logical plan to cover up the entire incident. Later, the body was recovered from where it was disposed of. The principal investigator, Kusanagi, was certain of Yasukoâ€™s involvement with the murder but was unable to find sufficient evidence. For a better insight, he summoned the assistance of the ingenious physicist, Dr Manabu Yukawa. Yukawa was a schoolfriend of Ishigami, and he suspected Ishigami. As the story progresses, there are more interesting twists and turns, keeping the readers thrilled and speculating. The Devotion Of Suspect X was published by Abacus in 2012, and available is in paperback.

In this unique graphic narrative, we finally have that candid, funny and relatable book on pregnancy and parenting that mothers, expectant mothers, and anyone even thinking about motherhood have been waiting for. Actor and writer Kalki Koechlin opens up about so much that we don't talk about-the social stigma of abortions and unmarried pregnancies, the toll that pregnancy takes on a body, the unacknowledged domestic labour of women, the emotional rollercoaster of giving birth, bouts of postpartum melancholy, the unsolicited parenting advice from every corner, and of course the innumerable moments of joy and delight in bringing a real little person into this very weird world. With whimsy and compassion, with uproariously funny art and spellbinding honesty, The Elephant in the Womb blends the deeply private with the blazingly political. It's an eye-opener for anyone who has ever thought that pregnancy was all about the glow and that motherhood was all about fulfilment. From fixing broken parts to enduring untimely farts, Koechlin's nuanced prose-gorgeously illustrated by Valeriya Polyanychko-tells us the bare-faced truth about the physiological discomfort and manic expectations that make it a bittersweet experience. With a combination of personal essays and think-pieces, journal entries captured in real time, reflections and anecdotes, this is the motherload!",https://www.buybooksindia.com/the-elephant-in-the-womb-9780143454052-70497.htm,low range

This book can be read to children from 2 to 9 years. It is a springboard for discussions regarding children's choices and their rights. The 'Note to the Reader' at the beginning of the book and the 'Discussion Questions' on the final pages, guide and enhance this essential discussion.It is crucial that our children, from a very young age, are taught to have a clear, strong voice in regards to their rights - especially about their bodies. In this way, they will have the confidence to speak up when they are unhappy or feel uncomfortable in any situation. A strong, confident voice as a young child converts to a strong, confident pre-teen, teenager and adult. With the prevalence today of online and offline bullying and various forms of abuse, such as physical, emotional and sexual abuse; our young people need to learn (from a young age) to always speak up when their rights are not being respected.The aim of this book is to empower young children and to give them a voice so they can grow up into empowered adults. When a child, teenager or adult says, 'No!' to any form of coercion, this should be immediately respected. A world where 'No!' does actually mean 'No!' can be a world with far less violence and increased respect for humankind. By educating our children to have true respect for one another, this world can be a much safer and more positive place.Body Safety Education (aka sexual abuse prevention education) empowers girls and boys through knowledge, and teaches them they have the right to say, 'No' and to respect other's personal boundaries. Both girls and boys need to learn to ask for consent and this can be taught from a very young age.Some of the scenarios in this book are typical of approaches used by sexual abusers (sexual predators/molesters/pedophiles) when grooming children for sexual abuse. Their aim is to desensitize the child to having their personal space violated and desensitize them to touch.

This book can be used by parents, caregivers, teachers and/or health professionals who may have specific concerns about a child, or who simply wish to 'check in' to see how their child is fairing, and is an ideal addition to their 'toolkit'. I strongly suggest using this book over a number of sessions, working through it slowly and at the child's pace; ensuring they have sufficient time to respond. This book should be thought of as a series of stimuli designed to initiate discussions about the child's feelings. It is NOT a series of questions that must be answered in a linear way. Be prepared to stop and listen to the child and be flexible in the use of this book. It is also important that the adult is an active listener, i.e. taking the time to 'hear' what the child may be trying to convey. Children, particularly young children, do not have the vocabulary or the experience to draw upon to express exactly how they are feeling. This book has been designed to assist parents, caregivers, teachers and health professionals to help children understand what they are feeling and why they might feel that way, and to encourage them to talk about and describe their feelings and emotions in a non-pressured, guided and safe environment. The questions in this book are suggestions only. The adult who is using this book with the child needs to follow the child's lead in order to have a meaningful and authentic discussion. Talking about challenging emotions and accumulating a ready bank of 'feeling' words helps a child to better express their emotions rather than act them out through negative behaviours. Providing children with the skills and words to express their feelings is key to helping them move forward in a positive way. Before using this book with a child, please familiarise yourself with the entire contents, and read 'Using this Book' on pages 37-39 so you are familiar with the questions and format",https://www.buybooksindia.com/talking-about-feelings-9781925089301-64035.htm,mid range

Also included are Discussion Questions for parents, caregivers and educators, and extra tips on how to reduce gender stereotyping. This book has been written to open up a conversation with children about their own individual preferences for toys, activities, games, books, etc. and to break down gender norms. In the long run, if we eliminate gender stereotyping there will be more choices for all genders, the likelihood of one gender believing they have power of another will be lessened, and children growing into adults will be free to follow their passions and be truly who they are. I hope you and the children in your care enjoy this book and the discussions it will bring",https://www.buybooksindia.com/who-am-i-i-am-me--9781925089325-64033.htm,mid range

A child growing up knowing they have a right to their own personal space, gives that child ownership and choices as to what happens to them and to their body. It is equally important a child understands, from a very young age, they need to respect another person's body boundary and ask for their consent when entering their personal space. This book explores these concepts with children in a child-friendly and easily-understood manner, providing familiar scenarios for children to engage with and discuss. It is important that the reader and the child take the time required to unpack each scenario and explore what they mean both to the character in the book, who may not be respecting someone's body boundary, and to the character who is being disrespected. It is through these vital discussions that children will learn the meaning of body boundaries, consent and respect. Learning these key social skills through such stories as 'Let's Talk About Body Boundaries, Consent and Respect' and role-modelling by significant adults can, importantly, carry forward into a child's teenage years and adult life.",https://www.buybooksindia.com/let-s-talk-about-body-boundaries-consent-and-respect-9781925089196-64029.htm,mid range

It tells of a girl named Alice falling through a rabbit hole into a fantasy world populated by peculiar, anthropomorphic creatures. The tale plays with logic, giving the story lasting popularity with adults as well as with children. It is considered to be one of the best examples of the literary nonsense genre. Its narrative course and structure, characters and imagery have been enormously influential in both popular culture and literature, especially in the fantasy genre. Dodgson's tale was published in 1865 as Alice's Adventures in Wonderland by ""Lewis Carroll"" with illustrations by John Tenniel. The first print run of 2,000 was held back because Tenniel objected to the print quality. A new edition was quickly printed, released in December of the same year but carrying an 1866 date. The entire print run sold out quickly. Alice was a publishing sensation, beloved by children and adults alike. Among its first avid readers were Queen Victoria and the young Oscar Wilde. The book has never been out of print. Alice's Adventures in Wonderland has been translated into at least 174 languages.

It is 12-year-old Alice Safford, the deeply-troubled daughter of a leading figure in government. The parasitic ghost follows her to her home on the Peak. There, the lethal mix of the two, embroiled in the family’s web of dark secrets and desperate lies, unleashes chaos.

The gathering of the tribes of the Mongols has been a long time in coming but finally, triumphantly, Temujin of the Wolves, Genghis Khan, is given the full accolade of the overall leader and their oaths. Now he can begin to meld all the previously warring people into one army, one nation. But the task Genghis has set himself and them is formidable. He is determined to travel to the land of the long-time enemy, the Chin and attack them there. The distances and terrain-the wide deserts, the impenetrable mountains-make it a difficult venture even for the legendary Mongolian speed of movement, but the greatest problem is that of the complex fortifications, a way of fighting wars of a settled urban population which the nomadic Mongolians had never come across. Finding ways to tackle that and keeping his tribes together in a strange environment presents another new and exciting challenge for Genghis Khan. Not only must Genghis succeed in this incredible campaign, but he must also reconcile the restless factions among his own generals, mediate between his ambitious brothers and cope with his own reactions to his growing sons. The young warrior has become a notable and victorious military commander of thousands: he must now learn to become a great leader of peoples of many different races and religions. Lords of the Bow is a deeply satisfying novel. It is epic in scope, convincing, and fascinating in the narration of an extraordinary story.

A child growing up knowing they have a right to their own personal space, gives that child ownership and choices as to what happens to them and to their body. It is equally important a child understands, from a very young age, they need to respect another person's body boundary and ask for their consent when entering their personal space. This book explores these concepts with children in a child-friendly and easily-understood manner, providing familiar scenarios for children to engage with and discuss. It is important that the reader and the child take the time required to unpack each scenario and explore what they mean both to the character in the book, who may not be respecting someone's body boundary, and to the character who is being disrespected. It is through these vital discussions that children will learn the meaning of body boundaries, consent and respect. Learning these key social skills through such stories as 'Let's Talk About Body Boundaries, Consent and Respect' and role-modelling by significant adults can, importantly, carry forward into a child's teenage years and adult life.",https://www.buybooksindia.com/let-s-talk-about-body-boundaries-consent-and-respect-9781925089189-61085.htm,low range

And why? Now, thanks to radical new technology and the obsession of a retired FBI agent, this book offers an answer. Rosemary Sullivan unfolds the story in a gripping, moving narrative. Over thirty million people have read The Diary of a Young Girl, the journal teenaged Anne Frank kept while living in an attic with her family and four other people in Amsterdam during World War II, until the Nazis arrested them and sent them to a concentration camp. But despite the many works â€“ journalism, books, plays and novels â€“ devoted to Anneâ€™s story, none has ever conclusively explained how these eight people managed to live in hiding undetected for over two years â€“ and who or what finally brought the Nazis to their door. With painstaking care, retired FBI agent Vincent Pankoke and a team of indefatigable investigators pored over tens of thousands of pages of documents â€“ some never before seen â€“ and interviewed scores of descendants of people familiar with the Franks. Utilising methods developed by the FBI, the Cold Case Team painstakingly pieced together the months leading to the infamous arrest â€“ and came to a shocking conclusion. The Betrayal of Anne Frank: A Cold Case Investigation is the riveting story of their mission. Rosemary Sullivan introduces us to the investigators, explains the behaviour of both the captives and their captors and profiles a group of suspects. All the while, she vividly brings to life wartime Amsterdam: a place where no matter how wealthy, educated, or careful you were, you never knew whom you could trust.",https://www.buybooksindia.com/the-betrayal-of-anne-frank--9780008353841-60236.htm,low range

A page-turning time travel adventure for children aged 8-11. Now enjoyed by over 250,000 young readers! When Stella and her younger brother, Tom, move to their new London home, they become mystified by the disappearances of Harry, their elderly neighbour's dog. Where does he go? And why does he keep reappearing wet-through? Their quest to solve the riddle over the summer holidays soon leads to a boat buried under a grassy mound - and a tunnel that takes them to a secret lake. Who is the boy rowing towards them? Why is he so terrified? And whose are those children's voices carried on the wind from beyond the woods? Stella and Tom soon discover that they have travelled back in time to their home and its gardens almost 100 years earlier. Here they make both friends and enemies and uncover startling connections between the past and present. The Secret Lake has been described by readers as a modern Tom's Midnight Garden and compared in atmosphere with The Secret Garden and the Enid Blyton and Nancy Drew mystery adventure stories. Its page-turning plot, with its many twists and turns, makes it a firm favourite with both boys and girls. Karen Inglis describes it as: ""a time travel mystery adventure with modern twists - the kind of story that I loved to read as a child, but brought right up to date"".",https://www.buybooksindia.com/the-secret-lake-9780956932303-59398.htm,low range

If the believer learns the Sunnah by reading and studying the hadiths, he will have a great reward, because this comes under the heading of learning knowledge. The Prophet (blessings and peace of Allah be upon him) said: ""Whoever follows a path in order to acquire knowledge thereby, Allah will make easy for him a path to Paradise."" Narrated by Muslim. This indicates that studying knowledge, memorising hadiths and discussing them are among the means of being admitted to Paradise and being saved from Hell. Similarly, the Prophet (blessings and peace of Allah be upon him) said: ""Whenever Allah wills good for a person, He causes him to gain understanding of the religion."" Agreed upon. Gaining understanding of the religion is attained through the Qur'an and Sunnah, and gaining understanding of the Sunnah is an indication that Allah wills good for a person.
Based on the above and other virtues of learning hadiths we have prepared this book for every age most properly for kids, young and adult to learn Authenticate hadiths. Also we have added so many stories related to hadiths so the learner have easy to understand of hadiths.

You have never seen Jeffrey Dahmer, Edmund Kemper or The BTK Killer like this.
This coloring book is definitely NOT for children!
The minds and motives of serial killers have always been an mystery to us, a strange but fascinating enigma that we seek to unravel; it is no surprise that, as much as people fear them, they can't stop learning more about these deadly, dangerous individuals whenever they can.
Their names are known and their reputations widespread, these monsters that haunt the night and bring us the cold, tingling sense of fear. The truth is - to be a killer is to turn the despicable act of murder into a personal twisted form of art, such as painting a portrait... which is why we've brought a book that brings both art and murder together, into one single work.
In The Serial Killer Coloring Book II we shall provide you with:
38 of the most well-known serial killers making an appearance in a new, incredible form.
High-resolution images which will allow you to fill in the smallest details and achieve the most realistic results.
Single-sided pages, with each image given its own page to save you from worrying about the colors bleeding through and damaging your next serial killer's image.
The most relevant symbolism to each killer, allowing us to tell you their story in a twisted and new way.
The possibility of a fantastic gift for your friends, family and loved ones who love the True Crime genre.
Are you ready to enter the world of the darkest brand of art?
